# Measurement

Prof. Yanyan Sheng challenged me to create my own functions, without using established libraries, and perform independent analysis on R for the class "Principles and Methods of Measurement", taught at the University of Chicago in the Spring of 2021.

## Functions

 - [dicht_vars.R](https://github.com/arrudafranco/Measurement/blob/main/Functions/dicht_vars.R) contains functions used to analyze dichotomous variables in the context of survey instruments and psychometrics.
 - [g_d_crossed.R](https://github.com/arrudafranco/Measurement/blob/main/Functions/g_d_crossed.R) contains functions used to analyze G-Study and D-Study crossed designs.
 - [g_d_nested.R](https://github.com/arrudafranco/Measurement/blob/main/Functions/g_d_nested.R) contains functions used to analyze G-Study and D-Study nested designs.
 
## Independent Analysis Projects
 
 - [rel_participation.md](https://github.com/arrudafranco/Measurement/blob/main/Projects/rel_participation.md) shows an interpretation of a factor analysis including religious and political participation variables from a large-scale representative survey in Latin America, including the code necessary to perform it.
 - [pentecostal_scale.md](https://github.com/arrudafranco/Measurement/blob/main/Projects/pentecostal_scale.md) shows reliability and criterion validity for a test to predict Pentecostal affiliation using a subset of items from the questionnaire of a large-scale representative survey in Latin America, including the code necessary to perform it.
 - [Religion in Latin America Dataset.sav](https://github.com/arrudafranco/Measurement/blob/main/Projects/Religion%20in%20Latin%20America%20Dataset.sav) is the dataset used.
 - [Religion in Latin America Codebook.docx](https://github.com/arrudafranco/Measurement/blob/main/Projects/Religion%20in%20Latin%20America%20Codebook.docx) is the codebook for the dataset used.

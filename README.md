# Measurement

Prof. Yanyan Sheng challenged me to create my own functions, without using established libraries, and perform independent analysis on R for the class "Principles and Methods of Measurement", taught at the University of Chicago in the Spring of 2021. 

 - [dicht_vars.R](https://github.com/arrudafranco/Measurement/blob/main/Functions/dicht_vars.R) contains functions used to analyze dichotomous variables in the context of survey instruments and psychometrics.
 - [g_d_crossed.R](https://github.com/arrudafranco/Measurement/blob/main/Functions/g_d_crossed.R) contains functions used to analyze G-Study and D-Study crossed designs.
 - [g_d_nested.R](https://github.com/arrudafranco/Measurement/blob/main/Functions/g_d_nested.R) contains functions used to analyze G-Study and D-Study nested designs.
